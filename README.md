## Data Availability

We understand the importance of data availability for transparency and reproducibility. While we plan to make the data used in our research available in the future, it is currently undergoing comprehensive analysis. 

In the meantime, for those interested in utilizing the code, please note that the required input data consists of two columns: one for time and another for tumor volume. Additionally, for the hypoxia data, input should consist of two columns: one for measured time and the other for the hypoxic fraction.

Please feel free to contact us for specific data-related inquiries or further assistance in utilizing the code.
